# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
Traffic Sign Recognition is a computer vision project aimed at automatically detecting and classifying traffic signs from images or video streams. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to develop a robust model capable of accurately identifying various types of traffic signs, including speed limits, stop signs, yield signs, and more. By enabling automated traffic sign recognition, this project contributes to enhancing road safety and improving the efficiency of autonomous driving systems.

Dataset
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing images of traffic signs along with their corresponding labels. The dataset is collected from various sources, including publicly available traffic sign databases, dashcam footage, and simulated driving environments. Each image in the dataset is labeled with the corresponding traffic sign class, allowing for supervised learning approaches to train the recognition model.

Models Used
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Deep learning architecture specifically designed for image recognition tasks, capable of capturing spatial hierarchies in visual data. CNNs have demonstrated remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks, including object detection and image classification.
Transfer Learning: Leveraging pre-trained CNN models such as VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet for feature extraction and fine-tuning on the traffic sign dataset. Transfer learning accelerates the training process and improves model performance by leveraging the knowledge learned from large-scale image datasets like ImageNet.
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly classified traffic signs among all signs, providing an overall measure of model performance.
Precision: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, indicating the reliability of the model's positive predictions.
Recall: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances, indicating the model's ability to correctly identify all instances of a particular class.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both metrics. F1 score is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets where the number of instances for each class varies significantly.
Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of model performance, showing the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. The confusion matrix provides insights into the types of errors made by the model and helps identify areas for improvement.

Example code for training a CNN model using transfer learning
import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2 from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

Load pre-trained MobileNetV2 model
base_model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

Add custom classification head
x = Flatten()(base_model.output) x = Dense(512, activation='relu')(x) output = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)

Create the model
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=output)

Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(val_images, val_labels))

Future Improvements
Data Augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques such as rotation, translation, and brightness adjustment to increase the diversity of training samples and improve model generalization.
Ensemble Learning: Combine predictions from multiple models using ensemble techniques such as bagging or boosting for improved robustness and performance.
Real-time Detection: Implement real-time traffic sign detection using video streams from dashcams or surveillance cameras, enabling immediate response to changing traffic conditions.
Deployment
Embedded Systems Integration: Deploy the trained model on embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi or Nvidia Jetson for real-time traffic sign recognition in autonomous vehicles or smart city applications.
Mobile Applications: Develop mobile applications for Android or iOS devices to provide on-the-go traffic sign recognition assistance to drivers, enhancing road safety and driving convenience.
